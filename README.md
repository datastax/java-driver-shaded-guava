Shaded Guava artifact, for use in the
[DataStax Java driver for Apache CassandraÂ®](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).

We publish this as a separate artifact to avoid re-shading it in every driver version (and every
module in each version). The build process creates a sources JAR with the relocated packages, but at
this stage the javadocs JAR is empty.
